## Is Climate Change Killing the Power?
If you’ve noticed that bad weather is knocking out electricity more than it used it, you’re not alone. As the climate crisis intensifies, energy utility experts and local activists have [raised concerns about lack of resiliency in America’s power grid](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/19/power-outages-texas-california-climate-crisis). Unfortunately, many of their concerns appear to have merit.

Since 2016, [weather related power disturbances](https://www.oe.netl.doe.gov/OE417_annual_summary.aspx) have gone up tremendously. Between 2016 and 2020, these outages increased by almost 400 percent.  From just 2019 to 2020, these disturbances almost doubled. This trend doesn’t look like it’s going to abate anytime soon. There have only been four fewer weather-related outages in the first half of 2021 than there were for the entirety of 2019. While some weather-related power outages can happen over localized areas and for short periods of time, truly severe weather has been driving the scale of these outages.

While the number of people affected by storm related outages has varied levels of growth over the past decade, catastrophic weather events are leaving more and more Americans without power. It isn’t surprising that unprecedented storms like Hurricane Sandy or Hurricane Harvey could leave millions of people without power. Winter weather, however, has often unreported, but disastrous effects on energy systems. With aging, and under-maintained, energy distribution systems in many parts of the U.S., [winter weather can break many mechanical parts responsible for distributing power](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/why-does-the-power-go-out-when-its-cold). Couple this with increased heating demand during winter storms, and severe winter storms are a breeding ground for outages. Furthermore, climate change will actually [increase the intensity of snowfall](https://www.climatecommunication.org/new/features/extreme-weather/winter-storms/) in many parts of the U.S.

Although weather outages are more common in warmer states, like Texas, Alabama, and California, it is increasingly likely that outage-prone northern states, like Michigan, may become the norm.

With the exception of California, states with the top ten most weather-related energy disturbances are having progressively more of them. From 2010 to 2020, weather outages in these states increased by over 250 percent. Four million more people lost power due to weather in 2020 than in 2010.
As these outages grow more frequent, there will be a need for improved weatherization of our energy systems. Some communities have [advocated for community choice aggregation](https://nextcity.org/urbanist-news/entry/energy-aggregation-has-potential-transform-how-we-get-power-hurdles-remain) to improve grid resilience. Even [energy utilities are trying to figure out the most feasible ways](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/16/texas-electricity-grid-extreme-weather-preparation/) to weatherize their infrastructure. There is no defined path to protect our energy system, but without timely improvements, the climate crisis is going to leave many people in the dark.
